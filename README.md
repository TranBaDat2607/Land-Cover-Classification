# Land-Cover-Classification
This repository contains implementations of land cover classification using UNet++ and DeepLabV3 with various techniques, including ensemble learning and transfer learning, to improve segmentation accuracy. The models are trained and evaluated on high-resolution remote sensing imagery to accurately classify different land cover types.
